# CSE4062S24_Grp5

This repository contains our projects for the CSE4062 Introduction to Data Science course. We worked with various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The algorithms we used are as follows:
- Supervised algorithms: ANN, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes
- Unsupervised algorithms: DBSCAN, k-means clustering
